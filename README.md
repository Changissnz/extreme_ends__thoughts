- "The guaranteed way to stop dealing with micro-aggressions is to kill the micro-aggressor." 
- "An implication of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle: maybe some people should get killed if they obsess over some other people too hard,it becomes threatening."
- "It's because my clock and their clock are different. And I think it's time for them to die...unless they want to step out of the way."
- "What if everyone involved in the campaigns were violently murdered? And the detectives and police that try to crack the cases? And the judges?" 
- "A parent is as good as a wealthy person or an institutionalist. And both kinds should die on a bad day."
- "Tell you what. If everything is a scandal or needs investigation, how about I kill the investigators as well as the alleged victims and perpetrators?" 
- "Everyone trying to make money off the lows should get violently murdered."
